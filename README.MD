# DevOps Home Exercise

*  Deliverable: a zip or otherwise compressed file. This file MUST include take_home.py and it MUST include a README.MD that will explain how to run this app so it works.

Instructions:

1) unzip file.
2) Execute the 'a.sh' file; you may need to  type 'bash a.sh'  -- This will then run docker-compose build; docker-compose up and a few other commands.  Due to some organization issue, the MySQL container takes longer to start up, so we start that container twice.

3) extra credit: see my Github for this done via Terraform + ECS
4) extra extra credit:  see my Github for this done via Kubernetes
